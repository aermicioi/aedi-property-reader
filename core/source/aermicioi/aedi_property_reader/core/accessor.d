Interface for objects that are able to get child component out of parent one.

The intent of property accessor is to provide runtime means of accessing various properties
out of a component which could be a D object, or struct. The implementation is free in allocation
policies in order to satisfy the property access, though the burden of freeing allocated memory
is left on code using the accessor.
